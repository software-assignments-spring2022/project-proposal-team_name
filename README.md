# Project Proposal

## Project Title
Mikutap + Gogoame

## What and Why?
The software gives some (aesthetic) feedback in response to random inputs and makes users feel connected to others. It helps to destress and relieve loneliness.

## For Whom?
People like me. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and don't want to do anything involving concentration (working, watching series, reading, gaming, etc.) and would aimlessly smash keyboards expecting some (not bad) feedback.

## How?
Mikutap is a webapp where users interact with the webpage by pressing keys, clicking, and/or dragging. Random patterns corresponding to the keys (e.g., "A" always gives parallel rectangles, while the orientation, colors, and sizes are random) will appear on the webpage after a pressing. Meanwhile, each key has one of the Gojuon, and the pronunciation will be played. The webpage is divided into squares where each square does the same thing as a key, and clicking or dragging through one of the squares does the same thing as pressing the key bound to that square. In short, Mikutap allows crazy (while remaining aesthetic) random painting and composing. A link to Mikutap is here: https://aidn.jp/mikutap/

Gogoame is another webapp where users can input a string, and every character of that string separately drops down as a rain droplet. All users synchronously share the raindrops (e.g., Adam types "abc," then "a," "b," and "c" drop on Adam's webpage as well as Alice's, assuming Alice is also visiting that site). A link to Gogoame is here: http://gogoame.sumbioun.com/

I want to combine these two webapps into one:
1. Users can collectively draw on the webpage. 
2. Users can input a string to see its effect instead of having to smash their keyboards non-stop.
3. Users can have word rain above paintings.

## Scope
No idea how much work involved.
